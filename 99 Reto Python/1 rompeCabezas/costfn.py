"""
This script computes de distances between a given
state and a goal state.

It removes all branches of a tree with suboptimal
distances by getting the distance of the current
state VS the goal state, ordering branches by such
metric and deleting half of them.

The reason for such cost function is the tradeof
between finding the best path and resource constraints.

So this script shouldn't be called often, as it will
very likely delete branches that could produce the
shortest path between zero and goal state, and it has
a performance hit itself.
