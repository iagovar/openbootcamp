# Palindrome integer checker

This script gets a range of integers (in a list), and returns all the valid palindromes of a given range (a list), the number of valid palindromes (an integer), and a string saying if a range is valid or not.

Check tests (with pytests) if you want, but the script is pretty simple and n00b.
